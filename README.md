ðŸŽ® Throwback Build #1 â€“ Cube Runner

Revisited an old Unity project: a 10-level 3D cube runner I built while learning game development.

âœ… Player movement & collisions
âœ… Level progression system
âœ… Game over + UI

This was one of my early wins and taught me the importance of small complete projects.
